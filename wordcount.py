# open file & assign to variable
# initialize dictionary
    # key = word, value = count of word
# iterate through by line
    # split line by space and put in list variable
        # remove non-alpha characters (extra enhancement if time allows)
    # loop through list
        # add word to dictionary/update count (in dictionary)
# unpack to print key/value pairs (using f string to print)
